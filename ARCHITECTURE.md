# Architecture

## Accessibility enhancements I made in this PR: 

* Added aria-label attributes to interactive elements (Input, search button, ResultList items).
* Implemented a different background color for ResultList items when hovered to improve visibility.
* Ensured sufficient color contrast for text and elements using the Colour Contrast Analyser tool (Colour Contrast Analyser).
* Restored focus to the Input after selecting an option.

## Futher enhancements that could be made :

* Enhance keyboard accessibility for ResultList items, allowing users to navigate and select options using the arrow keys and enter key.
* It's recommended to use a visible label instead of a placeholder for the input field to maintain clarity, as placeholders disappear once users start entering data and may not provide sufficient contrast for readability.
